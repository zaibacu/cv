About
======
A project which is basically CV generator for myself.

Generating newest version
==========================


Prerequisites
--------------
It is based on [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/), thus relevant packages are required.
Currently it expects to find `pdflatex` compiler.

GNUMake - compile process uses a little bit of [GNUMake](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/), thus this tool is required as well

Actual generation
------------------
`make` command should do everything for you, output is `main.pdf` file.

===============
It is expected to be found in [Releases](https://github.com/zaibacu/cv/releases) section
